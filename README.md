# PyRedis
A lite version of a Redis server implemented in Python.

_This project is inspired and guided by ["Write Your Own Redis Server"](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-redis) from [John Crickett](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/johncrickett)'s [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/)._
